# As the user, I want to specify a transmission tree with sampling times, transmission times and direction of transmission events (who infected whom):
# Example Newick Tree:
# ((C:1,B:1)B:2,A:3)A:1;
# Internal node labels specify who infected whom, and branch lengths indicate the timing of transmission events and host sampling
CompartmentType:
  'pathogen.tree':

    coalescent.rate: 0.1                              # single rate to be applied to all objects of this CompartmentType
    bottleneck.size: 1                                # bottleneck size when transmission event occurs
  'host.tree':
    transmission.rates: (host.tips=0.1, host.nodes=0.1)
