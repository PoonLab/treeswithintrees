# As the user, I want to specify a transmission tree with sampling times, transmission times and direction of transmission events (who infected whom):
# Example Newick Tree:
# ((C:1,B:1)B:2,A:3)A:1;
# Internal node labels specify who infected whom, and branch lengths indicate the timing of transmission events and host sampling
CompartmentTypes:
  'host':
    unsampled: 20
    susceptible: 1000
    branching.rates: (host=0.2)     # only one CompartmentType, in this case represents transmission rates
    migration.rates: ()             # assume no migration
    bottleneck.size: 1              # bottleneck size when transmission event occurs
    wait.time.distr:                # distribution of waiting time between infection time and first sampling time of a Compartment
      distr: 'exp'
